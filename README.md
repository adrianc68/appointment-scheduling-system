### Functional Requirements

- The system should allow selecting a time range and block that slot for at least 2 minutes before the appointment is canceled. The selected time range should have a maximum duration of 8 hours.
- The system should only allow scheduling a maximum of one appointment per user.
- The system must notify the administrator, client or assistant within 10-15 seconds when an appointment is created, finalized or canceled.
- The system must send automated reminders (via email or SMS) to users (clients, assistants, or administrators) about upcoming appointments at predefined intervals (30 minutes before the appointment).
- The system should keep a record of all past appointments and their statuses (completed or canceled) and allow users to view their appointment history.
- The system should allow clients to cancel appointments before the appointment is started.
- The system should automatically detect scheduling conflicts and prevent them (like race condition).
- The system must allow up to 10 minutes of overlap between appointments.

| Rich Internet Application (RIA) | Provides a more interactive and responsive experience than traditional web apps, with reduced dependency on the server. RIAs can be easily updated because the logic and interface are managed centrally on the server, but the rich client-side interactivity allows for a smoother experience. Modifications on the client side can be done independently of the server-side changes, improving **modifiability**. Once loaded, an RIA can work with minimal server communication, improving the performance and responsiveness of the application. | CON-2, QA-6, QA-3              |
| Service Application             | A service application (API Layer) encapsulates core functionality and ensures **reliability** through modular design. This separation reduces the chance of failure in one part affecting the whole system. It supports **scalability** and **reuse** of services for multiple clients like mobile, web, and CLI. It does not provide a user interface but rather expose services that are consumed by other applications.                                                                                                                            | CON-1, CON-3, QA-9             |
| 3 tier                          | Provides a simple, well-established separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data layers, which enhances **reliability**, **scalability**, **maintainability**, and cost-effectiveness without introducing unnecessary complexity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | CON-1, CON-3, QA-9, QA-3, QA-6 |

| Web Application | Typically, web applications are less interactive and rely heavily on page reloads for updates, which can make the user experience feel slower and less responsive. Standard web apps can suffer from performance issues, particularly when dealing with high-frequency updates or large amounts of data. Each user interaction may require a round-trip to the server, leading to latency and slower user experience. |
| 4 tier          | Introduces an additional layer that increases operational complexity and overhead, suitable for complex systems with advanced routing, traffic management, or microservices needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Use Angular to implement the front-end component for Web Browsers                    | Angular is selected because the team has experience with this framework and because it supports the development of responsive front-ends. This is necessary to support **CON**-1<br><br>Discarded alternatives are:<br>-React: While React provides a flexible and fast rendering engine, it does not provide as many built-in features as Angular, which would require the team to integrate additional tools for routing, state management, and form handling, potentially complicating maintainability and increasing development time<br>-Vue.js: Although Vue.js is easier to integrate and offers simplicity, it is not as widely adopted in enterprise-scale projects as Angular. This could pose challenges in terms of long-term support, available resources, and scalability for the project. It may also lead to potential issues with cohesion and maintainability in larger teams or projects.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Use Swift for the Mobile Application (IOS)                                           | Swift is selected for iOS app development due to its strong performance, modern syntax, and security features. It provides a native and highly optimized experience for iOS users. It is necessary to support **CON-3**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Use Android (Java/Kotlin) for Mobile Application Development                         | Android is selected due to its wide user base and flexibility in supporting different device types. With Java/Kotlin, the team can leverage a large ecosystem, ensuring scalability and maintainability. This is necessary to support **CON-3**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Host the code on a proprietary Git-based platform (GitHub)                           | GitHub is selected due to its industry-standard status, support for Git workflows, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and its broad ecosystem of tools that facilitate collaboration, version control, and code reviews. It supports **CON-2** by providing **interoperability** with development tools and services.<br><br>Discarded alternatives: GitLab (while it offers similar features, GitHub has a larger user base and integrations with other platforms).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Implement Concurrency Control Mechanisms to Avoid Race Conditions                    | To ensure **reliability**, the system will implement mechanisms like **optimistic concurrency control**, **pessimistic locking**, or **transactional consistency** to prevent race conditions during concurrent data modifications. These mechanisms will ensure that multiple users or processes can access and modify shared data safely, without causing inconsistent or corrupted states. It is necessary to support **QA-10** and **CON-4**<br>  <br>Discarded alternatives: Not using any concurrency control (which would lead to unpredictable behavior and data corruption in high-load scenarios).<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Use C# for Application Server                                                        | C# is selected for the application server because it is well-suited for building **scalable, high-performance web applications**. It has a strong ecosystem with **ASP.NET Core**, which offers robust support for building REST APIs and can handle high numbers of concurrent connections. **C#** supports **asynchronous programming** for high scalability and **reliability** (QA-10) by enabling the application to handle multiple requests without blocking threads.  <br>Additionally, the **.NET** ecosystem provides excellent tooling for continuous integration and testing, improving **modifiability** (QA-3).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Use a relational database                                                            | A relational database is selected due to its ability to enforce **data consistency** and its **maturity** in handling complex queries. Relational databases (RDBMS) ensure **data integrity**, and they are well-suited for structured data where relationships between tables are critical. They also offer **transactional support** to handle large amounts of data reliably. The database choice supports **QA-9** (reliability) by ensuring that the application maintains data consistency even in the face of failures.  <br>  <br>Discarded alternatives:  <br>- **NoSQL databases**: While NoSQL databases provide flexibility, they lack the strict consistency guarantees and transactional support required by the system, which could lead to data inconsistency in critical business processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Use Docker containers for deployment                                                 | Because the application has to be moved across environments (QA-7), deploying the application as a set of container images is preferred.<br><br>Virtual Machines are discarded because they are considerably larger than container images and requires more resources  than containers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Define and expose REST APIs to the front-end and document them using Swagger/OpenAPI | REST APIs are chosen to facilitate communication between the front-end and the back-end. These APIs provide a standardized way for the front-end (Angular, Swift, or Android clients) to interact with the business logic and data layers. The use of **Swagger/OpenAPI** ensures that these APIs are well-documented and easily understandable by both developers and automated tools.<br><br>The documentation provides clarity and reduces ambiguity during development, contributing to better **modifiability** (QA-3) and **interoperability** (QA-7). Additionally, it helps improve **testability** (QA-7) by enabling automated API tests.<br><br>**Discarded alternatives:** SOAP: While SOAP provides a more rigid protocol for communication, it is less flexible and has more overhead than RESTful APIs. GraphQL: While GraphQL offers fine-grained data fetching, it can lead to more complex queries and requires more effort to implement and maintain. This would increase development time and complexity, which is not necessary for the current system. |
| Use TLS (HTTPs) to encrypt data in transit                                           | TLS (Transport Layer Security) is selected to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the front-end and back-end, as well as any communication with external systems. By encrypting data in transit, TLS prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and eavesdropping on sensitive information, such as user credentials or payment details. This choice supports **Security** (QA-2) and ensures compliance with industry standards for data protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Encrypt confidential data in database with symmetric encryption                      | Confidential data, such as user passwords, financial records, and other personally identifiable information, is encrypted within the database to protect it in the event of a data breach. Using encryption ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, sensitive data remains unreadable. This supports **Security** (QA-2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Iteration 2: Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality

#### Step 2. Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

In this iteration, the design focuses on the back-end of the application. The goal is to identify structures that support primary functionality. The first use cases considered are:
* CE-1 Register client
* CB-1 Assign availability time slot
* CC-1 Register assistant
* CD-1 Register service
Since these use case and its modules are CRUD-based and share related behavior, I chose to apply domain decomposition to create components and accommodate the functionality within the architecture. This approach follows the reference method describe by John Chessman in "A Simple Process for Specifying Component-Based Software".
#### Step 3. Choose Elements of the System to Refine

In this iteration, the elements to be refined are the modules located across the different layers defined by the two reference architectures established in the previous iteration. The functionality needed to support the system’s use cases will require the collaboration of components located in these different layers, ensuring they work together to provide the necessary services.
#### Step 4. Choose Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers

The following table summarizes the design decisions.

| Design Decision and Location                             | Rational and Assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Select Domain-Decomposition for Component-Based Software | Domain decomposition is selected as the primary approach for defining the system’s components because the core functionality is centered around CRUD operations that share related business behavior. By organizing components based on business domains, each module can encapsulate related logic, making the system more maintainable and scalable. This also enables better isolation of concerns, allowing each domain to evolve independently while still maintaining clear boundaries between the components. Domain decomposition provides a natural mapping to the system’s use cases. |
| Select Repository Pattern                                | The repository pattern is selected to abstract the data access logic, providing a consistent and clean interface for CRUD operations while decoupling business logic from persistente concerns. This improves maintainability by centralizing queries and enhances reusability and separation of responsibilities, aligning with SOLID principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Select Observer Pattern                                  | The observer pattern is selected to enable reactive notifications between components, ensuring data consistency and integrity when entities are modified. It decouples emitters from observers, promoting modularity and scalability by allowing new observer to be added without altering existing logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Select Mapping Strategy for Database Model               | A mapping strategy is selected to bridge the gap between the business logic model and the database model, to allow clear separation of concerns, where the business model focuses on domain logic while the database model optimizes persistence. This strategy is used with an ORM tool using the Repository pattern to streamline the mapping process and manage complex relationships or queries.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)                         | DTOs are used to decouple the data representation from the business logic, optimizing the transfer of data between layers or external clients. It is used to allow the system to expose only the required fields while hiding internal structures, enhancing security and reducing payload size in API responses. They also enable flexibility in data formatting without affecting the core logic or persistence models.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Create REST API Controllers                              | REST API controllers are created to handle client request and serve as the entry point to the system. They ensure a clear separation between the presentation layer and business logic, making the API more maintainable and testable. Controllers are used for mapping HTTP requests to appropriate Application Facade methods, validating inputs, and formatting responses, enabling efficient and scalable communication between the client and the system.                                                                                                                                  |

#### Step 5. Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities and Define Interfaces

The instantiation design decisions considered and made are summarized in the following table:

| Design Decision and Location                                                                      | Rational and Assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Locate Controllers and DTOS into Services Layer                                                   | Controllers and DTOs are placed in the Service Layer to handle interactions between clients and the business logic. This ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing the layer to focus on input validation, data transformation, and communication.            |
| Locate System Interfaces into Business Logic Layer                                                | System interfaces are located in the Business Logic Layer to define the contracts that encapsulate the core functionality. This allows the business logic to evolve independently while providing a clear API for the service and data layers.                       |
| Locate Business Interfaces and Business Components into Business Logic Layer                      | Business Interfaces and Components are placed in the Business Logic Layer to centralize domain-specific operations and encapsulate the core business rules, promoting modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns.                                           |
| Create an Application Facade implementing System Interfaces and coordinate Business Components    | The Application Facade provides a unified interface to the Business Logic Layer by implementing system interfaces and coordinating the interaction between the Business Components, simplifying client interactions and reducing coupling with the underlying logic. |
| Locate Repository Interfaces and Repository Components with its Database Entities into Data Layer | Repository interfaces and Components, along with database entities, are placed in the Data Layer to encapsulate persistence logic, abstract data access details, and promote maintainability and testability.                                                        |
